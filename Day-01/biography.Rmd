## Life

I was raised in Kingston, Jamaica. In 1995, I was born the second child to both my parents. Before attending Macalester, I completed high school and elementary school in Jamaica. Now at college in the United States, this will then be my first time living outside of my island.
 
## Interests

During my tenure at high school, I developed a strong passion for mathematics and the sciences. To some extent, I also like the humanities which include but are not limited to:
 

* Anthropology
* Art History
* Gender Studies
 
However, my interests extend beyond academics. I also like visiting various environmental attractions and art museums, practicing photography and reading fictional books.

## Intended Major

As previously stated, I am interested in Mathematics and the sciences, specificaly Physics. I am also thinking about possibly majoring in Economics.
